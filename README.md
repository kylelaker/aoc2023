# Advent of Code 2023

This is my solutions to Advent of Code 2023 in Java. Each day is implemented as a Java
class annotated with `@Day` and each part is annotated with `@Part` to allow for dynamic
discovery of each solution.

## TODO

- [ ] Support situations where part 1/2 need different inputs
- [ ] Better checking on the signatures for `@Part`s
